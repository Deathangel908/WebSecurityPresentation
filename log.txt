А)xss. How to defeat.
1)non-persistent exist during execution. Query isn't escaped and displayed in the dom
 Attackers notices it and send an email to people. Folks open email and scripts inject into page executing malicious code.
 2)   persistent - even more devastating than non-persistent, thus it's much more easier to hack.
  It calls this way coz it persists on disk (e.g. database)
  3) Self-XSS - trick user to open webconsole and run some malicious code
  4) mXss - same as xss but using innerHTML (use textContent/innerText if you must instead)
Б) cors (cookies on same port, read-only cookie, preflight, origin)
В) server-side
Г) CRSF
Д) CLickjacking
1. when related entity id doesn't belong to user
2. When architecture allows to execute any method in controller
3. Sql injection
4. spam vulnerability ( snohub 4 digits number login) sending 10000 request and login as a user
5. not having captcha (fb example with record)
6. running from root user
7. ssl 
8. transactions
